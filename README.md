# The Spaceship
The Spaceship is a mobile game I made using Unity.


## About This Game
Your mission is clear: fly as far as you can without crashing into any obstacles. But it won't be easy â€“ the further you travel, the faster your spaceship will go, and the harder it will be to avoid disaster. And with each new level, the challenge increases as you encounter more and more dangers in your path. Luckily, your spaceship is equipped with a range of special powers that can help you overcome any obstacle in your path.
